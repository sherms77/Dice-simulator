# Dice-simulator
Dice simulator created with Python.
The user is asked if they want to roll the dice or quit the game.
If they choose to roll the dice, a random number between one and six will be produced.
After the number has been produced, the user will be asked if they want to play again or quit.
If the user chooses to quit the game, the program will end.
This project was completed August 2020.
